    	<div class="Guidelines">
    	<p>1. <b>Write for a large audience.</b> When defining a word, make sure to provide enough context for other people to understand what it means and how it’s typically used. Need a little help? Look to our Word of the Day for some examples.</p>
    	<p>2. <b>Be creative.</b> Some of the best definitions on NovGenT Dictionary find humorous ways to poke fun at authority, or put a clever twist on current events. Some of them are just straight up weird. We’re okay with that.</p>
    	<p>3. <b>Have fun.</b> We are not a traditional dictionary. This is a place where language has a little more space to be explored and constructed freely, in the moment.</p><br><br>
    	<img src="Dont.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70px; height: 85px;">
    	<p>1. <b>Don’t post personal information.</b> The users must strictly observed the privacy rules and any use of personal info like full names, addresses, age etc are prohibited it must be anonymous</p>
    	<p>2. <b>Don’t be an asshole.</b> We are okay with people defining offensive words. After all, people use offensive words in the real world and a resource for understanding what those words mean can be valuable. However, we are not—and never will be—okay with people using a definition to harass, discriminate, and/or directly incite violence against others.</p>
        <p>3. <b>Hipster language is strictly prohibited.</b> The users are not allowed to create and to use hipster language like jejemon and bekimon. Take note: this dictionary is for academic purpose only.</p><br><br>
